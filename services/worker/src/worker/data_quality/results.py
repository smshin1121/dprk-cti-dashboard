"""Type definitions for the data-quality gate runtime.

This module defines the common vocabulary every part of the DQ
system speaks in:

  - :data:`Severity` — the closed set of outcome levels. Enforces the
    D9 2-level severity model (``warn`` / ``error``) **plus** the
    ``pass`` outcome row (per D5, which allows pass rows in
    ``dq_events`` for trend baselines without treating pass as a
    severity band).
  - :class:`ExpectationResult` — frozen dataclass returned by every
    expectation function. Every sink (DB, JSONL, stdout) reads from
    the same instance so the DB row and the JSONL mirror are
    guaranteed semantically identical.
  - :class:`Expectation` — binding of a stable expectation name to
    its check function. The runner uses ``name`` for error
    synthesis when the check raises.
  - :class:`Sink` — Protocol every sink implements. Async-only so
    DB sinks and stdout sinks can be fanned out through the same
    code path.
  - :class:`SinkError` — returned (not raised) by the runner when a
    sink's ``write`` raised. The runner continues to the next sink
    on failure so a broken DB connection does not prevent the JSONL
    mirror from being written.
  - :class:`RunnerOutcome` — what :func:`run_expectations` returns.
    Carries the results list, the sink errors list, and a convenience
    ``worst_severity`` accessor for CLI exit-code decisions.

See docs/plans/pr7-data-quality.md D5 / D6 / D9 for the contract
this module commits to.

#: Closed set of expectation outcome levels. ``pass`` represents
#: "expectation ran and found nothing above the warn threshold" and is
#: persisted to ``dq_events`` so the "DQ pass rate" KPI (§15) can be
#: computed from presence rather than inferred from absence. ``warn``
#: and ``error`` are the two severity bands D9 locks — no third band
#: is permitted, and extending this Literal is a load-bearing change
#: that should force a new decision ID.

class ExpectationResult:
    """The outcome of running a single expectation against the DB.

    ``name`` is the stable dotted-identifier for the expectation (e.g.
    ``"reports.tlp.value_domain"``) and is what downstream trend
    queries group by. It MUST match the ``name`` of the
    :class:`Expectation` wrapper — the runner verifies this on the
    error-synthesis path.

    ``observed`` and ``threshold`` are both :class:`decimal.Decimal` so
    ratio-based expectations (dedup rate, null rate) stay exact
    instead of going through float and accumulating drift. ``int`` and
    ``float`` literals coming from the check functions are coerced by
    ``__post_init__`` so callers do not need to remember to wrap
    primitive literals.

    ``observed_rows`` is the **violating / affected row count** for the
    expectation — i.e. the number of DB rows that actually failed or
    contributed to the measured ratio, NOT the total scan size. For
    value-domain / year-range / referential-integrity checks this is
    the count of invalid rows; for null-rate it is the null row count;
    for dedup-rate it is the duplicate row count (``total - distinct``).
    The full scan-size context (total rows, denominator, etc.) lives
    under ``detail`` (e.g. ``detail.total_rows``,
    ``detail.total_non_null``, ``detail.db_canonical_count``) so
    dashboards that want "M out of N" reconstruct both from a single
    result instance.

    ``detail`` is a free-form JSON-serializable dict for expectation-
    specific context (which rows failed, which canonical was missing,
    what the allowed enum set was, etc.). Both the DB sink and the
    JSONL sink pass this dict through unchanged — if it contains
    non-JSON types, the sink will raise and the runner will record a
    :class:`SinkError`.

    ``observed_at`` is generated at construction time (or supplied
    explicitly by tests / replay code) and is used verbatim by every
    sink so a DB row and its JSONL mirror carry the identical
    timestamp. Must be timezone-aware.
